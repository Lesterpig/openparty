This open-source project is a **simple** and **fast** framework for multiplayer chat games, written in clean javascript.
It uses **node.js, socket.io & angular.js** technologies. It is able to create a webserver for that purpose.

Under slow development. Check issues for more information.

Features
--------

- **Realtime** game rooms accross the web
- Multiple rooms & gameplay support
- Highly customizable gameplay definitions to suit your needs
- No registration required for players
- Fully tested by an automatic process
- And more !

For what games ?
----------------

With **Open-Party**, you should be able to play to an infinite number of games!

- Quizzes
- Role-based text games, like "Mafia"
- *Even yours?!*

Basically, it's just a framework, and you'll have to program games that have not been developed yet.
But it's a lot more simple and user-friendly than basic IRC bots, don't be afraid :)

How to install ?
----------------

You'll have to download the source code, and then download additionnal gameplay definitions.
